- I spent most of the 4 hours doing backend code and adjusting front end events on webforms. 
- I used a "update panel" to be more responsive page.

- If I would have more time I would do a bootstrap gridview using jquery code like:
    $(document).ready(function () {
        $('#<%= GridViewPatients.ClientID %>').dataTable({

- And backend code on the event 
    GridViewPatients_PreRender

- But I confess that I'm using React and Angular last months

- So I think I will need only maybe some hours working with to remember every thing from Webforms/bootstrap.
